This would be a GREAT comeback for those asking for bribes...could you imagine this happening in Malaysia? #Rasuah #MACC #sprm #MakingMalaysiaGreatAgain
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki has been embroiled in a share trading controversy. Here is the timeline of the whole issue. #anticorruption #macc #azambaki #rasuah #sprm #c4center
"MACC shld be renamed to Malaysian All Corrupted Cabinet SPRM Suruhanjaya Pengamal Rasuah Malaysia. Where is ur integrity, where is ur due responsibility n uphold the law towards the nation and the people. U all choose to ignore every oath u all have taken. BLITHERING IDIOT"
"Apa pukimak sangat MACC ni. “Anti rasuah” yang backup perasuah gila babi, sampai KL lockdown nak protect Azam Babi, and now this, further threatening someone who complained of being threatened."
"LIVE | It's a busy morning outside Parliament today. PKR Youth members are lined up outside chanting “lawan lawan rasuah, undur undur Azam Baki"". The @SecComMY recently announced that there was ""no conclusive evidence"" of proxy trading by the MACC chief."
"BOMBSHELL - A CASE OF 'YOU CATCH ME, I CATCH YOU'? - AS SC SWOOPS DOWN ON AZAM BAKI, REPORT LODGED WITH MACC AGAINST SC BOARD OVER RM28 MIL GRAFT 'INVOLVING TOP POLITICIANS HOLDING GOVT POSITIONS' - IS MALAYSIA DOOMED TO BE A 'BANGSA RASUAH' TRAPPED IN https://malaysia-chronicle.com/?p=213597"
"????????????????... Umno's culture ... ALL RASUAH & FRAUDS & FAILURES WILL BE FORGOTTEN, FORGIVEN, FOREGONE & 'INSYA-ALLAH'... Leaders, muftis & ulamaks can do NO WRONGS! Do the right thing and resign, Gomez tells MACC advisory board members"
"Kaki rasuah azam kena kantoi. macc instead of protect the whistleblower, now the bloody head of macc is suing whistleblow. Kangaroo court of malusial is sepupu macc, so efficient in fixing suit management date."
The MACC confirmed that it had received the go-ahead to bring the Grade 41 officer to court. Gred 41 pun makan rasuah ke? Bodoh. Anti-graft officer to be charged over alleged RM25mil theft linked to ex-spy chief's case
MACC? Pencegah Rasuah? Ptuuuih! ????Bangsat!
"“Video itu bertujuan mendidik masyarakat serta memberi kesedaran kepada orang ramai mengenai perbuatan menawar, memberi dan menerima rasuah.” The MACC also says it appreciates all the efforts, sacrifices and contributions of the country’s medical practitioners."
"Lebih besar kemaluan negara bila timbul isu rasuah ke atas ketua pencegah rasuah sendiri, seolah MACC is just a joke. Ada yg berbangga dgn kononnya Malaysia negara melayu islam, tapi orang luar pandang Malaysia lebih hina dan busuk dari kandang babi. Truly"
"Korupsi, Rasuah everywhere in Msia! Tapi MACC Tak Akan Siasat!??"
MACC is now investigating officials from Securities Commission? Siapa pegawai anti-rasuah kita tuan puan? Mat rempit ke?
Dari Cegah Rasuah to Makan Rasuah! Msia Boleh! ????????????The MACC Board do what Msia does Best! Buat Bodoh & Tak Tahu! ??Tak Malu Ke?
Susah payah doktor berperang mulut dengan MACC pasal doktor tak makan rasuah.
Yang protect MACC dengan SC adalah yg unpatriotic sebenarnya. Rasuah sekarang ini adalah state sanction policy.
Lalitha Kunaratnam berkata beliau menerima surat perintah dari Azam Baki hari ini berhubung penerbitan artikelnya di laman sesawang Independent News Service. #MalaysiaNow #MNow #MNowNews #Malaysia #Macc #rasuah #SPRM https://t.co/QgK30HXthO
Netizen vs MACC…..kalau ada politician yg memperjuangkan hukuman mati bagi pesalah rasuah…tak kisah la yg ambik ka atau yang bagi…aku akan sokong n undi org tu sampai bila2
Ni la raja rasuah tangkap sama dia macc ptui…ludah dia punya muka
No one will believe sampah #MACC so might as well bungkus! Close shop! Ada mcm takde.. rasuah berleluasa tangkap punya sikit! Whistle blow pun kamu bukan check malah kasi sue!! Puiii!
Come forward and we will protect you: MACC tells whistle-blowers
"Public trust towards MACC is gone. Didn't your chief suing the whistle blower now? What rubbish are you talking? Clean MACC officers should resign or get transfer elsewhere, in solidarity with the public reaction. Show rakyat we have ""maruah""."
MACC protecting its chief Azam Baki and not the whistle blower in the share scandal.... So stop the crap talk about protecting whistle blowers
Sorry MACC-right now rakyat dnt thrust many government organizations and MACC is one of them…even judiciary has lost it…sorry but that’s the reality
"THE BIGGEST SCAM IN 2022. ""Come forward and we will protect you: MACC tells whistle-blowers"""
"funny lah… didn’t the MACC chief just issued legal letter to the whistle blower? Say one thing, but do otherwise leh"
LOL sapa nk percaya lps azam baki sue pemberi maklumat ??????????????
Why MACC give such statement... Bodoh... Dah laaa.... Ramai Rakyat diperbodohkan... Masih nak bodoh kan lagi.... Stupid
Reporting macc for scam
@SPRMMalaysia awal2 lagi dah buat lawak April Fool ??????
Hahaha whistle blower got sued for 10mil...that's how you protect them ah
"I would never be a whistleblower - wherever in the world you may be, I have a perception it almost never ends well - and here in Malaysia it’s very likely the outcome could be a lot worse, depending on whose toes you are stepping on"
"Can you believe This Shit promise.. remember?..once you turned in yourself and you are in MACC Compoun, watch..you are at their mercy"
"Maybe MACC has different definition of the word ""PROTECTION"". #justsaying #rasuahbuster"
All the trusts we have have with MACC have already been misplaced. You have to work and catch your boss first then we see what can be done.
"Sebagai pegawai atasan MACC yang di amanahkan menlindungi negara dari gejala rasuah, tiga Abdul ni sepatut nya beri sokongan pada siasatan yang buktikan Azam tidak bersalah. Bukan beri pendapat peribadi mereka. Langsung zero nilai."
Sebab kamI patriotik lah kami serang MACC & SC. Yang badut ni defend sgt org yg akan skandel rasuah ni kenapa? Telur hang kena pegang ka?

In what way is this chap connected to Lalitha Kunaratnam of C4? Is he the deep throat who provided C4's Lalitha Kunaratnam with the information regarding MACC's Azam Baki? And is this why C4 is now trying to distance themselves from Lalitha Kunaratnam?
Azam Baki said articles written by Lalitha had caused the readers of the articles to conclude that he was a corrupt civil servant who abused his position as the top officer in MACC to cater for his interests and that of his siblings. https://t.co/3jB8UtFsS3

"Look world, look at Malaysia. Look how corrupt our leaders are. The MACC chief might hv d*ck pics of everyone to see such backings. #Corrupt #TangkapAzamBaki #Malaysia"
This real-life example of an absolutely corrupt doctor — who certified ppl on MySJ for Covid vax without actually vaccinating them — is 1000x worse than that MACC vid of forged MCs. It casts the entire Covid vax program and stats into doubt. All medical groups must speak out.
"Blocking the roads, shutting down train stations, intimidating the organisers and getting court orders to prevent peaceful assembly are NOT ensuring the safety of anyone except safeguarding the corrupt head of MACC. #TangkapAzamBaki"
"What does it mean for you, to be Malaysian? It is eating nasi lemak? Drinking Teh tarik? Our Diversity? Open house? Kueh mueh for tea? Macam mana mau settle? Mata-mata? Corrupt politicians and MACC?"
"MACC MEMBER RESIGN..? If the Malaysian Anti -Corruption Party is corrupt, what kind of country is this? Malaysia? or MALAYURASUAH?"
We are so corrupt that we don't even know who should investigate and prosecute Azam Baki and the MACC. God help us all.
The connotation of MACC is Malicious Abominable Corrupt Criminals OR Manipulative Arrogant Comedians Clowns

"Whistleblower only against najib. Everything else, especially the corrupt anti corruption agency's big boss is considered defamation. Way to go MACC! ??"
"When a country is so corrupt, a corrupt macc chief is the king!"
Parliament to review is just not being silly but plain stupidity. The majority is in the hands of the Corrupt to whom MACC is subservient.

"No proof then find proof, or else nothing can be done, it's that simple. Now this case is very obvious he had violated law. Lalitha is just doing her job, whistleblower or what we don't care but what we want is with proof arise, action need to be taken!"

"First step to curb corruption in Malaysia would be to address the Official Secrets Act 1972 v. Whistleblower Protection Act 2010, and how one prevails over the other. Enable the whistleblowers. If a centralized system isn't efficient enough, decentralize it to the Rakyat."
Only in Malaysia can the corrupt sue whistleblowers and get away with it. This country is so fucked.
Whistleblower kena sued ? Malaysia fight against corruption is back to anarchy. Corruption = Poor Development = Poor Malaysians. #Malaysia

Journalists faced intimidation and whistleblowers blew authorities’ top for uncovering corruption scandals. Find out more in this week's #FOEWatch

Malaysia is poor at protecting whistleblowers. The reason why we don't have accountable leaders. We can't call out on anybody's mistakes without going to court. just a mere opinion.
"Only in Malaysia where the whistleblowers are treated as criminals when the the infomation they provided are correct, accurate and true."
"Whistle blower should be protected ,as this peoples who are in authorities are trying to threaten and suppress them with millions of ringgit cases against them , these intimation case should be thrown out if ever.reach the court ."
"Bravo ??MACC.. So that’s how you guys work… Whistle blower’s allegation not only you dun investigate, but you straight away intimidate and threaten.. after this no one dares to whistle blow. No whistle blow means no corruption. Means no work for MACC. Memang Boleh!"
"Many cases that MACC handles must be from whistle blowers & they are protected by the law. But now, when it affects the Commissioner of MACC, AB wants to sue & intimidate them, the very helper of MACC! Here AB is not appreciating WB help."

Malaysia kan memang. Orang jadi whistleblower yang kena hunt. Yang buat jenayah boleh senang lenang ??Tak ada saluran betul
"Kita ada akaun macam Edisi Khas kerana di Malaysia, whistleblower selalunya tak mendapat pembelaan sewajarnya. Whistleblower kena maintain anonymous sebab kalau mereka dedahkan secara terbuka, bakal mendapat ancaman termasuklah ancaman bunuh."
"Dalam dunia korporat, beria-ria promosi whistleblower, siap ada saluran pelaporan & carta alir proses. Dalam kerajaan, orang yang melaporkan pulak disiasat LOL. Lapor siap bagi bukti tu. Bukannya sembang kosong. Sebab tu Malaysia tak maju. Tadbir negara macam warung keluarga."
Pelik kat Malaysia ni whistleblower pulak yang orang nak tangkap. Yang corrupt apa semua masih bertenang. Gila babi atas bawah corrupt.
Protect whistleblower my ass ??Aku kata dah Malaysia ni beyond saving. Melingkup la semua oi
Penat juga jadi whistleblower kat malaysia ni.. so elok scroll tiktok je la
Whistleblower act malaysia ni boleh tiup je.. tak function pon
"Okay la tu, bagi pendapat percuma je takyah bayar singgit. ??Kalau boleh bagi pendapat tu, maknanya orang tu ada daya fikir & KBKK. Kalau pendapat tu bernas, elok dicadangkan kepada jabatan. Jangan jadi whistleblower je kat Malaysia sebab nanti polis siasat hahahaha"
"Pelik-pelik Malaysia ni, yg kena bongkar sebab buat salah tak disiasat, tapi whistleblower yg kena buru. Kalau macamni ka keadaan, lepas ni orang dah tak pedulilah apa2 pun."
Kalau nak jadi whistleblower kat Malaysia ni kena duduk kat tempat terpencil baru diorang tak dapat detect
"Tapi Malaysia nyer governance and compliance is soooo weird. Whistleblower they hunting down olah-olah diorang plak yg salah. Bile Dino and stupid people at the top, ni lee jadinya. Yang hamba abdi olak - janji meleis isley"
"Whistleblower diburu macam buru penjenayah ya? Penjenayah sebenar elok je keluar masuk Malaysia, pergi kempen. Terbalik sudah."
"Akta yang ni butoh sikit. Memang kata protect whistleblower, tapi whistleblower tu memang boleh kena saman malu. Benda bodoh pasal bank adik ni pun obvious menipu tak boleh harap dengan law sangatlah malaysia"
"Kalau legit, memang bersyukur ada whistleblower berbolakan besi di Malaysia"
Jadah lah whistleblower kat Malaysia kena protect. Ni bukti kau takkan di protect bawah sebarang akta berkaitan whistleblower. Nak harapkan siapa lagi sial kat Malaysia ni semua haram jadah
"Woi Azam whistleblower ni penyampai maklumat, tak kisah lah betul ke tak. Kerja SPRM lah siasat bodoh. Kau sekolah ke tak ni nak suruh dia minta maaf jadahnya! Rosak lah Malaysia macam ni ??"
'Whistleblower' patut counter sue. Semoga yang benar menang. Bukan Malaysia ni ada whistleblower act? Dan kalau tak silap SPRM patut lindungi whistleblower ke?
"Bila whistleblower kat Malaysia nih tak pernah selamat, sebab tu la penyamun makin bermaharajalela.."
